# deBif 0.1.0 (3/3/2022)

* First official version to be submitted to CRAN. The intensive computational parts (solving for solution points, solving for limit cycles) 
are now carried out by C-code. The package has been tested intensively by a group of BSc students during a 4-day class 

# deBif 0.0.5 (3/6/2021)

* Compared the computation of the limit cycle condition and the jacobian of the limit cycle condition with the same computations in Matcont. The jacobian and the limit cycle condition differ less than 1.0E-5 from each other, showing the correctness of the code
