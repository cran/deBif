Title: Bifurcation Analysis of Ordinary Differential Equation Systems
Version: 0.1.9
Authors@R: c(person("Andre M.", "de Roos", email = "A.M.deRoos@uva.nl", role = c("aut", "cre")))
Description: Shiny application that performs bifurcation and phaseplane analysis of systems of ordinary 
    differential equations. The package allows for computation of equilibrium curves as a function of 
    a single free parameter, detection of transcritical, saddle-node and hopf bifurcation points along 
    these curves, and computation of curves representing these transcritical, saddle-node and hopf 
    bifurcation points as a function of two free parameters. The shiny-based GUI allows visualization 
    of the results in both 2D- and 3D-plots. The implemented methods for solution localisation and curve
    continuation are based on the book "Elements of applied bifurcation theory" (Kuznetsov, Y. A., 1995;
    ISBN: 0-387-94418-4).
